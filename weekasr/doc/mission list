CTC Seq2Seq
Attention Seq2Seq
CNN classification(CE loss)
Capsule network
divide the unknown data along with their original labels
generate silence data from background noise
use the prefix and suffix data in each wav file as silence data(in seq2seq model)


using Attention joint CTC
using CNN+muti-frame+CTC
Capsule network with EM routing
using mono-phone as output
using VAD cut the away silence data in the word wav file
combining input frame
combining time-field and feq-field features, or ensemble at last
postprocessing-compute Levenshtein distance,find the best match word(char-level seq2seq)
